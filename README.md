### esymail

#### What is esymail?
esymail attempts to be the near all-in-one solution to email needs in a professional space. During my work at [esyoil.com](https://esyoil.com) I encountered a lot of difficulties finding the right tools for stable email delivery.

esymail attempts to solve all the issues I encountered within one product including - but not limited to - the following things:
- simple setup, easy to host
- SMTP or API for sending messages
- detailed access-control Framework
- different mail-servers in one setup, divided into companys
- build-in domain managment & DNS setup guide
- suppression-listing feature
- bounce detection and managment
- webhooks to report back to the system
- high throughput sending volume

##### What is esymail **not**?
esymail will not be a manager for mailing-lists or any other kind of distribution system. It will simply put a sending and receiving email server. 
Tho we have plans to add some kind of plugin system, we are not building esymail with the above mentioned in mind.

##### What do we plan to accomplish?
We are trying to build a tool where all difficult things in the broad term "email" are handled automatically, so you can focus on actually sending emails or develop your product further instead of maintaining a complex system. 

##### Design
We are no designers, so we are looking for help during the frontend-development part of the project. I have started a little mockup over [here](https://www.figma.com/file/cwF4JxXmjDEuDl1eBGYLOw/email-server?node-id=0%3A1)
